# Maze-Solver

Now solve everyday maze problems appearing in morning newspapers just by using this program. 
Input path as 0. wall as 1 and destination as 2.
Suppose a simple maze of dimension 5X5 is following:
               1 1 1 1 1 /n
               0 0 1 0 1 /n
               1 1 1 0 0 /n
               0 0 1 1 0 /n
               2 1 1 0 0 /n
Input starting point (rows, coloumn) [in range 0-4 i ncase of this example, since dimension is 5X5]
Output will be path from starting point to end point(represented by 2)

# Algorithm
Brute force approach. 
Recursive function.

# Updates (In progress)
Able to solve maze in images using image processing in JAVA
